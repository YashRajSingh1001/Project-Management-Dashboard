# Project-Management-Dashboard
This Project Management Dashboard has been created in Excel. It can be utilized to oversee multiple projects, each with distinct teams, managers, tasks, and timelines. Leveraging a combination of Excel's developer functions, conditional formatting, and intricate formulas, I've engineered a comprehensive tracking system that empowers efficient project monitoring and evaluation.

At the core of this dashboard lies a dataset encompassing essential parameters for each project. It contains details like Project Names, corresponding Task Names, designated Managers, Start and End Dates, Duration, Days Completed, Progress, Budgets, and Actual amount spent. By structuring this information within Excel, I've formulated a dynamic interface that facilitates comprehensive oversight and analysis.

Utilizing Excel's Developer functions, I've orchestrated an intuitive user interface that allows seamless updates and modifications. This interface ensures ease of use while maintaining data integrity, enabling swift updates of project statuses and associated metrics. Employing conditional formatting techniques, I've designed visual cues within the dashboard to instantly highlight critical information. Key performance indicators, project milestones, budgets and actual spending are vividly highlighted, drawing immediate attention to areas that require focus or action. The heart of this system lies in its complex yet robust formulas. These formulas dynamically calculate project durations and track progress against predefined milestones. By automating these calculations, the dashboard provides real-time insights into project health and performance metrics. 

In summary, this Excel-based project management dashboard amalgamates meticulous data organization, user-friendly interfaces, and formula-driven computations. It can serve as a comprehensive tool for project managers and stakeholders, enabling efficient tracking, analysis, and decision-making across diverse projects and teams.

I welcome any suggestions or feedback that could enhance the functionality or usability of the dashboard for better project management.
